# Networking with NS2 Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains Tcl scripts for simulating various network scenarios using NS2 (Network Simulator 2). NS2 is a widely used tool for simulating network protocols, scenarios, and traffic patterns. These scripts aim to demonstrate different networking concepts and protocols, including TCP, UDP, and network topology configurations.

## Features

- Simulates network scenarios using NS2.
- Demonstrates TCP and UDP communication.
- Includes scripts for creating network topologies.
- Suitable for learning computer networking concepts and experimenting with NS2.

## Compatibility

These scripts are designed to run on Linux systems. NS2 is primarily developed for Unix-based systems and has been tested on various Linux distributions.

## Requirements

- **NS2 (Network Simulator 2):**
  - NS2 is required to run the simulation scripts. It can be installed from the package manager of your Linux distribution.
- **Linux Operating System:**
  - The scripts are compatible with Linux-based operating systems.

## Installation and Setup

To run NS2 on your Linux system, follow these steps:

1. **Install NS2:**
   - NS2 can be installed from the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use the following command:
